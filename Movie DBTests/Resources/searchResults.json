Graham Dalby provided the theme music You're the Cream in My Coffee and he appeared with his orchestra in two episodes. Stylish images of the 1920s are featured, including a classic Rolls Royce limousine and art deco fashions and jewellery worn by the title character.\n\nThe series was shown in the United States by PBS broadcaster WGBH as part of its Mystery! anthology strand, and introduced by Diana Rigg. The full series was also aired in Australia in 2011 by the Seven Network's station 7Two.",

In the last seven months, nothing has quantitatively changed for Pacquiao, who is still on a winning streak and still one of the most insanely famous people in the world. And yet it feels like things are on the precipice of changing. There's no need to trot out the \"oh, how the mighty have fallen\" cliché for him just yet. But there's something vaguely in flux about the Filipino living legend's aura, and the idea of the mighty falling is suddenly conceivable.",
